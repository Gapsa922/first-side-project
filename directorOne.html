                <p>Jean-Luc Godard was born on 3 December 1930 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, the son of Odile 
                    (née Monod) and Paul Godard, a Swiss physician. His wealthy parents came from Protestant families 
                    of Franco Swiss descent, and his mother was the daughter of Julien Monod, a founder of the Banque 
                    Paribas. She was the great-granddaughter of theologian Adolphe Monod. Other relatives on his mother's 
                    side include composer Jacques-Louis Monod, naturalist Théodore Monod, pastor Frédéric Monod, and 
                    former Prime Minister and later President of Peru Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. Four years after Jean-Luc's 
                    birth, his father moved the family to Switzerland. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Godard was
                     in France, and returned to Switzerland with difficulty. He spent most of the war in Switzerland, 
                     although his family made clandestine trips to his grandfather's estate on the French side of Lake 
                     Geneva. Godard attended school in Nyon, Switzerland.
                        Not a frequent cinema-goer, he attributed his introduction to cinema to a reading of André 
                    Malraux's essay Outline of a Psychology of Cinema, and his reading of La Revue du cinéma, which was 
                    relaunched in 1946. In 1946, he went to study at the Lycée Buffon in Paris and, through family 
                    connections, mixed with members of its cultural elite. He lodged with the writer Jean Schlumberger. 
                    Having failed his baccalauréat exam in 1948 he returned to Switzerland. He studied in Lausanne and
                    lived with his parents, whose marriage was breaking up. He spent time in Geneva also with a group that
                    included another film fanatic, Roland Tolmatchoff, and the extreme rightist philosopher Jean 
                    Parvulesco. His elder sister Rachel encouraged him to paint, which he did, in an abstract style. 
                    After time spent at a boarding school in Thonon to prepare for the retest, which he passed, he 
                    returned to Paris in 1949.He registered for a certificate in anthropology at the University of Paris 
                    (Sorbonne), but did not attend class.</p>
