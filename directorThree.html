            <div class="aboutText">
                <p>Malick was born in Ottawa, Illinois. He is the son of Irene (née Thompson; 1912–2011)[5] and Emil A. 
                Malick (1917–2013), a geologist. His paternal grandparents were of Lebanese and Assyrian descent from
                Urmia. Malick attended St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin, Texas, while his family lived in 
                Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Malick had two younger brothers: Chris and Larry. Larry Malick was a 
                guitarist who went to study in Spain with Andrés Segovia in the late 1960s. In 1968, Larry 
                intentionally broke his own hands due to pressure over his musical studies. Their father Emil 
                went to Spain to help Larry, but his son died shortly after, possibly by suicide. The early death 
                of Malick's younger brother has been explored and referenced in his films The Tree of Life (2011)
                and Knight of Cups (2015).
                Malick received a B.A. in philosophy from Harvard College, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta 
                Kappa in 1965. He started a BPhil in philosophy (a two-year master's degree) at Magdalen College, Oxford,
                as a Rhodes Scholar. After a disagreement with his advisor, Gilbert Ryle, over his thesis on the concept
                of world in Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein, Malick left Oxford without a degree.[16] In 1969,
                Northwestern University Press published Malick's translation of Heidegger's Vom Wesen des Grundes as 
                The Essence of Reasons.
                After returning to the United States, Malick taught philosophy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
                while freelancing as a journalist. He wrote articles for Newsweek, The New Yorker, and Life.</p>
