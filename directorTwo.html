                <p>Andrei Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in the Yuryevetsky District of the Ivanovo 
                    Industrial Oblast (modern-day Kadyysky District of the Kostroma Oblast, Russia) to the poet and 
                    translator Arseny Aleksandrovich Tarkovsky, a native of Yelysavethrad (now Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine), 
                    and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute who later worked as 
                    a corrector; she was born in Moscow in the Dubasov family estate.
                    Andrei's paternal grandfather Aleksandr Karlovich Tarkovsky (in Polish: Aleksander Karol Tarkowski) 
                    was a Polish nobleman who worked as a bank clerk. His wife Maria Danilovna Rachkovskaya was a Romanian
                    language teacher who arrived from Iași. Andrei's maternal grandmother Vera Nikolaevna Vishnyakova 
                    (née Dubasova) belonged to an old Dubasov family of Russian nobility that traces its history back to
                    the 17th century; among her relatives was Admiral Fyodor Dubasov, a fact she had to conceal during
                    the Soviet days. She was married to Ivan Ivanovich Vishnyakov, a native of the Kaluga Governorate
                    who studied law at the Moscow State University and served as a judge in Kozelsk.
                    According to the family legend, Tarkovsky's ancestors on his father's side were princes from the 
                    Shamkhalate of Tarki, Dagestan, although his sister Marina Tarkovskaya who did a detailed research 
                    on their genealogy called it "a myth, even a prank of sorts," stressing that none of the documents 
                    confirms this version.
                    Tarkovsky spent his childhood in Yuryevets. He was described by childhood friends as active and 
                    popular, having many friends and being typically in the center of action. His father left the 
                    family in 1937, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. He returned home in 1943, having 
                    been awarded a Red Star after being shot in one of his legs (which he would eventually need to 
                    amputate due to gangrene). Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister 
                    Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press.
                    In 1939, Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School No. 554. During the war, the three evacuated to 
                    Yuryevets, living with his maternal grandmother. In 1943, the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky 
                    continued his studies at his old school, where the poet Andrei Voznesensky was one of his classmates.
                    He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school. The family lived on 
                    Shchipok Street in the Zamoskvorechye District in Moscow. From November 1947 to spring 1948 he was
                    in the hospital with tuberculosis. Many themes of his childhood—the evacuation, his mother and her
                    two children, the withdrawn father, the time in the hospital—feature prominently in his film 
                    Mirror.
                    In his school years, Tarkovsky was a troublemaker and a poor student. He still managed to graduate, 
                    and from 1951 to 1952 studied Arabic at the Oriental Institute in Moscow, a branch of the Academy of 
                    Sciences of the Soviet Union. Although he already spoke some Arabic and was a successful student in
                    his first semesters, he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the 
                    Academy of Science Institute for Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold. He participated in a year-long 
                    research expedition to the river Kureyka near Turukhansk in the Krasnoyarsk Province. During this 
                    time in the taiga, Tarkovsky decided to study film.</p>
